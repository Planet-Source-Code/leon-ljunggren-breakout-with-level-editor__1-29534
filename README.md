### Description

This is a simple clone of the game Arcanoid (Breakout). It got five different levels and three difficult levels.

It also got a high score list and various options (diff levels, and colours on the objects) that are saved from run time to run time and a very simple level editor.

Feel free to use the code however you like. And please give me feedback on what you think of it.
